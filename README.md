# Pong-Exercise
Ya can play it here : <itch project not public yet>

This is a simple remake of the Atari game pong that I did to get some trainingggg. Made in Unity.

So um in singleplayer ya can play with the arrow keys and choose the difficulty. The speed of the ball increases each time it bounces off a player.

If ya wanna play with someone they can control the left player with W and S.

Have fun! I'm gonna go back and do some more coding exercises.
